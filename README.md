# Mesebox
A mod for Minetest that provides a mobile storage called Mesebox.

## Background

There are still many mysteries surrounding Mese, the ore that can be found deep underground. Some say even it's of alien origin. Recently, however, scientists have unlocked one of its mysteries and invented the Mesebox. The power of the Mese combined with a storage box creates a storage that can be dug and carried without losing its content. The original recipe crafts a Mese-colored Mesebox and if combined with dye, Meseboxes of various colors can be crafted.
